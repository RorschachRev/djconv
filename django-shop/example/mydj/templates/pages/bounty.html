<br>
Who is MediaCoin?:<br>
<br>
MediaCoin is a US software development company specializing in encrypted content delivery. Using AES encryption on both client and server, combined with the use of a wallet's private key, MediaCoin has developed a platform that will allow artists to distribute their content digitally without the possibility of piracy, while being able to distribute that content to a worldwide audience.<br>
<br>
Quantum MediaCoin Token (QMCT or QMCTe):<br>
<br>
QMCT and QMCTe will be the token used across the MediaCoin Platform to purchase audio and video files on a pay-per-play, or per session basis. MediaCoin has decided to use both the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic blockchains, which will allow for easier adoption, and higher availability of the currency by users.<br>
<br>
How will it work?<br>
<br>
Artists will choose the rate to view the content per session, or per play, and 100% of the revenue generated from the sales of the content will go directly to the artist's network. We believe that artists should be able to choose how much or how little should be required to view their content.<br>
<br>
What is the problem we are solving?<br>
<br>
The Music Industry has failed to provide an adequate compensation for the time and talent artists put into making their content, and failed to simply keep that content from being stolen. Common platforms of today (such as Soundcloud, Spotify, Pandora, ect) will distribute content in an unprotected manor. Once an artist becomes popular their content quickly becomes valuable and needs to be protected. Unfortunately, these platforms have no option to protect content from piracy.<br>
In the United States alone, $2.7 BILLION in revenue is lost annually due to content piracy. Digital content theft has become a plague for artists. They have been looking for a solution for over 10 years, and MediaCoin has developed that solution.<br>
<br>
What is our solution?<br>
<br>
Using AES encryption methods combined with the delivery of encryption keys to wallet addresses, we have made this possible. This encryption technique uses blockchain technology to revolutionize the way we deliver data today.<br>
<br>
To show the capabilities of our software we are starting with the MediaCoin Platform, which is our proof of concept. Fortunately for privacy and security worldwide, our plans do not end there. Within 6 months we plan moving toward enterprise solutions by assisting medical facilities with HIPAA compliance, E-learning and E-campus for schools, and secure live streaming of sporting and entertainment events.<br>
<br>
Finally this technology will allow us to become a Meta ISP, and using MVNO cell data, a mobile Virtual Network Operator. If you are intrigued and would like more technical information about our project, please read our whitepaper at https://mediacoin.stream/<br>
